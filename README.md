# Credit Card Fraud Detection Streamlit App

This repository contains a machine learning model and a Streamlit web application for detecting credit card fraud. The model is trained on the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which includes transactions made by credit cards, where we have to identify fraudulent transactions.

## Features

- Utilizes Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers for the analysis.
- The Streamlit app allows users to input transaction details and get predictions on whether a transaction is fraudulent.
- Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
